# Introduction to Tensorflow Neural Networks

There are two files in this introduction:

1. `basic_regression.py` is the the first file, an introduction to building and training a neural network using Tensorflow
2. `basic_adversarial.py` is the second file, which is used to explore building and training a neural network using an adversarial training approach, where the neural network is trained on both correct and incorrect data

Both files use a neural network to solve the following equation:

$$$ y = 2x -1 $$$
