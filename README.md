# tf-ML

A project for better understanding of building and training a machine learning (ML) neural network (NN) using the Tensorflow Python package.

Focusing on:
- Anomaly Detection/Outlier Detection
- Adversarial Training/Robust Training


#### Installing Necessary Packages
1. Create a conda environment for running tensorflow:
   `conda create --name <env_name>`
2. Activate the conda environment:
   `conda activate <env_name>`
3. Install tensorflow into the environment:
   `conda install tensorflow`
4. Install any other packages:
   `conda install numpy` etc.
5. Now things should be ready to go!

<b>NOTE:</b> This installation instruction is extremely simple, and assumes Python and conda are already installed.
